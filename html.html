	  SYMPHONIC BAND- Through very mysterious means, Junior Michael Xu has become first chair tuba player. This event was very unexpected, given how terrible of a tuba player Xu is. Likely reasons for this include Dr. Wheeler going deaf, powerful intimidation (unlikely given who Michael is), and the distinct possibility that aspiring humor writer Ely Sandine was out of ideas. </p>
<p>This event has astounded many students and faculty alike. When interviewed on Xu's success Dr. Ray Wheeler, Assistant Principal of Music/Arts/Technology, stated simply "Michael has no intonation." Wheeler then proceeded to tell a twenty minute anecdote from his life as a well intonated musician. When asked the same question, former physics teacher Dr. Winkel responded, "baa ba ba ba ba ba ba baaaaaaaa ba ba ba ba ba ba BAAAAA." This statement was later confirmed to be a Bb major scale. </p>
<p>To solve this mystery fellow tubists from the band were also asked to comment on this unexpected event. Former first chair tubist, Samuel Kim, was unable to be found and is believed to have switched to baritone horn upon hearing the controversial announcement. The second chair tubist, Junior Jenny Han, appeared to be confused by the question and responded simply by stating, "Ely Sandine is a much better tuba player and person in general than me." Lastly, third chair tuba player, Senior Ely Sandine, when asked about Michael’s ascension provided the illuminating quote, “Can I please join spec humor now?”</p>
